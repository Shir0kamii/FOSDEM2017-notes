UX of UX
========

Be Welcoming
------------

New contributors maintain the spirit of the project
Use contribution guidelines
Better for everyone, including shy people

Use wiki effectively
Bring beginners to speed easily using it

Use tags
Difficulty + category, not only category

Onboarding
----------

When you want to contribute
It shouldn't be hard to have the project running
Reduce installation steps
eg WP: 5mn install

Design objectivity (pixel fucking)
You shouldn't enforce the exact design of contributions
If it's not super important, let the contributor own the work

Define a design language (Visual guide)

Feature requests
----------------
Implement relevant requests, not all
Use polls if you're not sure

Open source is still engineering driven
You should make sure not to over-engineer, it lead to unusable things

Conclusion
----------

The community should lead more
